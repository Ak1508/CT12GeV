List for offline monitoring:
(Here is the list of things that we need for the offline monitoring of the data quality)

1. Reconstructed spectrometer quantities (hsdelta, hsxptar, hsyptar, hsytar, ssdelta, ssxptar, ssyptar, ssytar).

2. Missing energy(Em), Missing momentum (Pm), Pm parallel to q-vector (Pm_par), Pm perp to q-vector (Pm_per), inv. mass W, four momentum transfer squared (Q^2).
See https://github.com/ for code to calculate these quantities.

3. Script to compare the spectrometer quantities and Em to the same quantities simulated by SIMC for each kinematic setting.
Set of cuts needed for any such comparison
 a) cuts on each of the spectrometer quantities defining good acceptance, same cuts should be applied to SIMC.
 b) PID cuts for electrons in HMS (hcer_npe, hcal_tot_energy, hcal_e1, hsbeta)
 c) PID cuts for protons in SHMS (scer_npe, scal_tot_energy, scal_e1, ssbeta)
d) cointime cut

4. Script to calculate coincidence yield from data using all cuts a--d and subtracting out the accidental coincidences (by averaging over the side peaks of the cointime spectrum).

5. Running count of background subtracted coincidence yield for each kinematic setting.
